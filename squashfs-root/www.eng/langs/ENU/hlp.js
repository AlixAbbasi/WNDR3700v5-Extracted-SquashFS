var hlp_h_openvpn="<body bgcolor=#0099cc ><P><font size=4><B>VPN Service Help</B></font></P><p>The VPN Service function allows you to access your home network in a secured way through the Internet when you are out of home. In addition, when you are out of the country, you can use the VPN Service to access the Internet sites or services for which there is a geographic limitation and they are not accessible outside the country. To use the VPN Service, you will need to locate your router through the Internet when you are out of home. There are two ways to do that and the suggested way is to use the Dynamic DNS service. The other way is to locate your router through its public Internet address and it is better to have static IP address settings for the router's Internet  connection. Please make sure you have either the Dynamic DNS service enabled or static IP address settings for your Internet connection.</p><p>To install VPN client on your client devices: </p><p>To use the VPN Service, you need to install the VPN client software on each device where you want to create a VPN connection to the router. Please follow the steps mentioned here to complete the installation. Basically you need to download the VPN client software that works for the system of your client device, install it on the client device, and configure the VPN settings on the client device (that includes installing configuration files on the client device and maybe changing some settings on the client device).</p><p>Service Type: You can use either TCP or UDP protocol to transmit the VPN packets.</p> <p>Service Port: This is the VPN Server port number to which a VPN client connects. The default is 12974.</p><p>Clients will use this VPN connection to access: There are three options “Auto”, “Home Network only” and “All sites on the Internet & Home Network”. With the “Home Network only” option, a VPN client can access only the Home Network through the VPN Service. If you want to access the Internet sites or services with a geographic limitation when you are out of the country, you have to select the option “All sites on the Internet & Home Network”. Please note that once you have selected this option, your VPN client will also access Internet sites and services that do not have a geographic limitation. For an Internet site or service that is normally accessible through the Internet (for example, public networks that do not have a geographic limitation), the access speed through the VPN Service is slower than the access speed without going through the VPN. The \"Auto\" option will do some intelligence checking and try to use the VPN Service only for necessary accesses (i.e. only for sites or services that are not accessible if not going through the VPN Service), but this is just a best effort function and a correct determination cannot be guaranteed.</p></body>";
